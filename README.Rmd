## rlpi Package for calculating indices of abundance change

```{r cars, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
# Install from main repository online
install_github("Zoological-Society-of-London/rlpi", auth_token = "2ad834796e37896eb28a01c303004c38ebad77dd")
# Install from local directory
#install("/Users/freeman.r/Dropbox/R/rlpi/")
library(rlpi)

# Get example data from package
# Copy zipped data to local directory
file.copy(from=system.file("extdata", "example_data.zip", package = "rlpi"), to=".")
unzip("example_data.zip")

# Terrestrial LPI with equal weighting across classes and realms 
# Default gives 100 boostraps (this will take a few minutes to run (on a 2014 Macbook))
terr_lpi <- LPIMain("terrestrial_class_realms_infile.txt")

# Nicer plot
ggplot_lpi(terr_lpi)

# Run same again, but used cached lambdas (force_recalculation == 0), and now weighted by class, but equal across realms (see infile for weights)
terr_lpi_b <- LPIMain("terrestrial_class_realms_infile.txt", force_recalculation=0, use_weightings=1)

# Putting the two LPIs together in a list
lpis <- list(terr_lpi, terr_lpi_b)
# And plotting them together should show identical means but with different CIs
ggplot_multi_lpi(lpis, xlims=c(1970, 2012))

# Can also plot these next to each other, and use some more meaningful titles
ggplot_multi_lpi(lpis, names=c("Weighted", "Unweighted"), xlims=c(1970, 2012), facet=TRUE)

# And can log the y-axis - need to set ylim as log(0) is -Inf
ggplot_multi_lpi(lpis, names=c("Weighted", "Unweighted"), xlims=c(1970, 2012), facet=TRUE, ylim=c(0.5, 2), trans="log")

```
